    <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1>
  </div>
  
  <p class="highlight">Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them 
    at high speed. They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured.</p>
  <h2>Attack </h2>
  <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be 
    <strong>spearers</strong> <!--Kiemelés-->
    or 
    <strong>smashers.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the 
    prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
  <h2>Eyesight </h2>
  <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about 
    independently of each other. They are considered to be the most 
    complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p>
  <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized 
    light, and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p>
